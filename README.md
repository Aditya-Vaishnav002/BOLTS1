⚡ BOLTS

BOLTS is my first full-stack web project, built to understand how frontend, backend, and deployment work together in a real-world setup.
This project helped me learn project structure, server–client connection, static file handling, and deployment using Vercel.

🚀 Live Demo

🧠 Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project was to:

Learn full-stack development basics

Understand folder structure in real projects

Connect frontend and backend

Deploy a project online (Vercel)

Debug real deployment and path-related issues

This is a learning-focused project, not a production-ready application.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

Deployment

▶️ How to Run Locally
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Vaishnav002/BOLTS1.git
cd BOLTS1

2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Start the server
node backend/server.js

4️⃣ Open in browser
http://localhost:3000

📌 What I Learned

How frontend and backend communicate

Importance of correct file paths

How deployment differs from local hosting

How to structure a real project repository

Debugging errors related to static files and hosting

⚠️ Limitations

UI is basic and focused on functionality

No authentication system yet

Code can be further optimized and refactored

Documentation is minimal (will be improved over time)

🔮 Future Improvements

Improve UI/UX design

Add authentication

Better API structure

Clean up and refactor code

Add more features step-by-step
